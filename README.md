# CS311_Project2
Create Dynamic FSA

In this project, we have two input files, Project2_Input1.txt and Project2_Input2.txt, that hold Java reserved words and a Java program respectively.

This Java program, DynamicFSA, simulates a basic symbol table manager to recognize Java reserved words and identifiers using a trie data structure that is implemented with three arrays.
